# Overview
Speech Emotion Recognition is a challenging task in the field of Natural Language Processing and Audio Signal Processing. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify emotions in speech. The model uses deep learning techniques to extract relevant features from the audio data and predict the corresponding emotion category.

# Dataset
The SER model is trained on a diverse dataset of speech recordings, carefully labeled with seven emotion categories: Angry, Stressful, Painful, Prank, Neutral, Sad, and Abusive voices. The dataset contains audio samples from various sources and contexts to ensure a robust and representative training.

# Model Architecture
The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model in this repository is composed of four Conv1D layers and two Dense layers. This architecture has been specifically designed for speech emotion recognition tasks and has proven to be effective in achieving a high accuracy of 95.5% on the evaluation dataset.

# Usage
To use the speech emotion recognition model, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
3. Prepare your audio data or use the provided sample dataset.
4. Run the 'Prediction.ipynb' script, providing the path to the audio file as input.
5. The model will process the audio and output the predicted emotion category.

Feel free to customize the script or integrate the model into your own applications for real-time emotion recognition.

# Results
The speech emotion recognition model achieves an accuracy of 95.5% on the evaluation dataset. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in accurately predicting emotions in speech. However, please note that the model's performance may vary depending on the input data and the specific context.
